# Lost Cities Scorer

I'm a big fan of the board game Lost Cities.
While scoring the game is not particularly difficult, it is much easier to use an app for this.
However, most apps do not allow the use of the 6th city available in the expanded edition.
This app does.
Additionally, this provided a useful opportunity to sharpen my frontend skills.
